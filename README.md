Transfer Learning

Base Models:

DenseNet201
VGG16


Pre-trained on ImageNet weights
Custom classification head

Training Strategy

10-fold cross-validation
Adaptive learning rate scheduling
Early stopping
Epochs: 12
Optimizer: Adam
Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

Running the Code

Training the Model

# In Jupyter Notebook or Python script

from src.training import train_cross_validate

# Train models

histories, models = train_cross_validate(folds=10)

Making Predictions

from src.inference import predict_flower

# Predict flower species
image_path = 'path/to/your/flower/image.jpg'
predicted_class, confidence = predict_flower(image_path)
print(f'Predicted Class: {predicted_class}, Confidence: {confidence:.2f}')
Performance Metrics

Validation Accuracy: Varies by model
Classes: 104 flower species
Robust classification across diverse flower types

Inference Example
# Sample prediction code
def predict_flower(image_path):
    # Preprocess image
    preprocessed_image = preprocess_image(image_path)
    
    # Predict using trained model
    predictions = model.predict(preprocessed_image)
    
    # Get top prediction
    predicted_class = CLASSES[np.argmax(predictions)]
    confidence = np.max(predictions)
    
    return predicted_class, confidence
Troubleshooting

Ensure TensorFlow is correctly installed
Check GPU/CUDA configuration
Verify dataset path and format
Use pip install --upgrade tensorflow if version issues occur

Future Work

Experiment with more advanced architectures
Implement model ensembling
Collect more diverse training data
Improve data augmentation techniques
